Part 1 Deploying local Jenkins as CI/CD tool
=====================================
1.	Log in to Red Hat OpenShift cluster via CLI.

2.	Create a CI/CD project by running the following command:
oc new-project my03-cicd --display-name="My CICD Project"

3.	Create a Jenkins application by running the following command:
oc new-app jenkins-ephemeral --param MEMORY_LIMIT=2Gi --param DISABLE_ADMINISTRATIVE_MONITORS=true --param ENABLE_OAUTH=true

4.	Set the resource requirements:
oc set resources dc jenkins --limits=cpu=2 --requests=cpu=1,memory=2Gi

5.	Watch the pods deploy: (Initiate a new terminal window.)
watch oc get pods

6.	Retrieve the route for your Jenkins application by running the following command:
oc get route jenkins -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}'

=====================================
Part 2 Deploying J2EE application using oc tool
=====================================

1.	Create a project by running the following command:
oc new-project my03-tasks --display-name="My Tasks Project"

2.	Create a Java Platform, Enterprise Edition application by running the following command:
oc new-app java:11~https://github.com/IBM-SkillsAcademy/OpenShiftDevOps2020 --context-dir=employeeman --name=employeemancicd

3.	Expose a route outside the Red Hat OpenShift cluster by running the following command:
oc expose svc/employeemancicd

4.	Watch the pods deploy: (Initiate a new terminal window.)
watch oc get pods

oc get events

5.	Retrieve the route by running the following command:
oc get route employeemancicd -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}'

6.	Verify that the application is running correctly by pasting the route URL into your browser.

7.	Turn off automatic deployments by running the following command:
oc set triggers dc employeemancicd --manual

8.	Give the Jenkins service account the edit role by running the following command:
oc policy add-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:my03-cicd:jenkins -n my03-tasks
